## About.





## Documentation.





##
* Asynchronous programming allows you to multiplex multiple networked connections on a single thread.
* The event loop and the reactor pattern simplify asynchronous event processing.





## Promise and Future.
A promise is used to write an asynchronous result, whereas a future is used to view an asynchronous result.





## Las bases mas solidas sobre las que se sustenta la programacion asincrona son:
* Execucion "no ordenada".
* Programacion sin bloqueos.
* Programacion dirigida por eventos.





## Asynchronous programming approaches:
* Threading
* Callbacks
* Promises/future
* Events
* Coroutines





## Protocols of Asynchronous Communication
* MQTT — Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is an ISO standard pub-sub based lightweight messaging protocol used widely in the Internet Of Things.
* AMQP — Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware.
* STOMP — Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol, (STOMP), is a text-based protocol modeled on HTTP for interchanging data between services.




##
* From a technical point of view, an asynchronous programming means a group of design techniques, which decompose code 
  into blocks of execution (events), that can be computed with derived result (we use subscribing in order to be notified
  about results).
* To sum up, when we talk about an asynchronous application, we mean that it is an application, that is composed from a 
  number of events, that run in some event loop, and has handlers, that subscribe for the result of event computation. 
  It is basically, a way to avoid blocking operations.
